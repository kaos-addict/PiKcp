Installing kcp is a pretty straighforward task.

1. DEPENDS
  Ensure the needed depends are installed on your system:
	- A go compiler (by default, go)
	- git (to make the compiled app work)

2. Prepare
	Launch configure script
	To get help about options, type: ./configure --help

2. COMPILATION
	Just launch the following command:
	  make

3. INSTALL
	Launch the following command:
	  make DESTDIR=<yourdestdir> install
	As result:
		- the binary file will be installed on <yourdestdir>/usr/bin
		- the man file will be installed on <yourdestdir>/usr/share/man/man1 (if man enabled)
		- the completion files will be installed (if enabled)

4. ENJOY!
