PiKcp

A command-line tool for my Pi-Aur repository

Just a quick & dirty hack of KCP to create an aur (arch user repository) clone via github. 

A *naive* and unrealistic objective would be to use it as an ARM (RaspberryPi-destinated and others?) aur alternative to be used beside on Arch Linux Arm System.

Forked from KCP: https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
